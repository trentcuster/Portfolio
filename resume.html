                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    I just graduated from Lehi High School in May and I am interested in a job with Computer Science. I
                    heard about the MATC program and I'm interested in the Web Development program. I want to be able to
                    get some experience and education and this sounded like a good way to do so. I want to be able to
                    work for Xactware at the end of this program so I can apply what I have learned and be able to pay
                    for the rest of my college education.
                </p>
                <br>

                        I have taken a computer programming class my senior year in high school. It went over the very
                        basics of C# and gave me a basic understanding of Computer Programming.
